Before I bore you with my philosophy on patience...

My name is Shawanda and I am a new developer. When I say new, I mean brand spanking new but excited about my tech journey. 

How are you?
 
Extremely well I hope!

Comfortable yet? Good.

My friend asked me 3 weeks into my bootcamp **"How's the coding thing going? Is it hard? It looks hard..."** and my rehearsed response was
>**"It's not hard per say... just a different way of thinking that I have to make natural."**

Smooth, right?

Little does she know, I've made more errors and mistakes on just 3 labs than I've made in my entire 26 years on earth.

But I think this is one of the reasons I am so intrigued by the whole idea of programming. To create anything or solve a problem I've had to understand and adopt the concept of being patient not only with myself but with a program that essentially wants me to communicate better.

Make sense? For example…

Errors or failed tests are problems that need to be handled with the intention to understand and communicate in way that the program comprehends and that takes patience. LIFE LESSON MUCH?!?!

Telling Ruby to loop "I LOVE CODING" until the user says "Ok, I've had enough." is completely different from how it would be coded in Javascript. And thats OK! The point is to not have the answers all the time but using those problem solving skills to fail until you get it right and learn in the process.

Not to say an error wont have you banging your head against a brick wall... well preferably something soft (safety first)... for a few hours or days or ~~months~~. Let’s not even go there because hell hath no fury like a a lab with 100 tests.

So for all of you new developers out there who are doubting if you can do this or are frustrated beyond belief, just know...

* Patience cultivates persistence, and persistence is the elixir for longevity.

* Keep going until you've given what you feel is your all... it makes you stronger for obstacles to come. And let's face it, there will ALWAYS be obstacles no matter what you are doing in life.

* Programming is only forcing you to become a better communicator in and outside of code

* It's ok to feel lost, but when you find your way out, the victory will be even sweeter.

* Surround yourself with those who understand your struggle to a degree because there will be those ogres in your life you call friends and family with their clever comments of "Oh… that looks hard and boring" refrain from throwing your entire laptop at them because...

###### Patience is truly a virtue

Until next time :)
